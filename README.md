This Python script interacts with the VirusTotal API to check the security status of a given URL. It performs two main functions:
1. Submit URL for Scanning: If the URL has not been recently scanned, the script submits it to VirusTotal for a fresh analysis.
2. Retrieve Scan Results: If the URL has been scanned before, the script fetches the latest scan results, displaying any security or reputation information from VirusTotal's aggregated antivirus engines.
